Getting started
===============

In order to start using EKO the first step is installing it, and can simply be
performed with |pip| as follows::

    pip install eko

The most recent versions of Python should be all supported (with some time
needed for the adoption of new releases).

In case of troubles, feel free to write an issue on the `repository
<https://github.com/N3PDF/eko/>`_.
