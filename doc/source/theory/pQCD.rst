pQCD ingredients
================

Strong Coupling
---------------

Implementation: :class:`~eko.strong_coupling.StrongCoupling`.

We use perturbative QCD with the running coupling
:math:`a_s(\mu_R^2) = \alpha_s(\mu_R^2)/(4\pi)` given at 5-loop by
:cite:`Herzog:2017ohr` :cite:`Luthe:2016ima` :cite:`Baikov:2016tgj`

.. math ::
    \frac{da_s(\mu_R^2)}{d\ln\mu_R^2} = \beta(a_s(\mu_R^2)) \
    = - \sum\limits_{n=0} \beta_n a_s^{n+2}(\mu_R^2)

It is useful to define in addition :math:`b_k = \beta_k/\beta_0, k>0`.

We implement two different strategies to solve the |RGE|:

- ``method="exact"``: Solve using :func:`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.
  In |LO| we fall back to the expanded solution as this is already the true solution.
- ``method="expanded"``: using approximate solutions:

.. math ::
    a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2) &= \frac{a_s(\mu_0^2)}{1 + a_s(\mu_0^2) \beta_0 \ln(\mu_R^2/\mu_0^2)} \\
    a^{\text{NLO}}_{s,\text{exp}}(\mu_R^2) &= a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2)-b_1 \left[a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2)\right]^2 \ln\left(1+a_s(\mu_0^2) \beta_0 \ln(\mu_R^2/\mu_0^2)\right) \\
    a^{\text{NNLO}}_{s,\text{exp}}(\mu_R^2) &= a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2)\left[1 + a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2)\left(a^{\text{LO}}_s(\mu_R^2) - a_s(\mu_0^2)\right)(b_2 - b_1^2) \right.\\
                                        & \hspace{60pt} \left. + a^{\text{NLO}}_{s,\text{exp}}(\mu_R^2) b_1 \ln\left(a^{\text{NLO}}_{s,\text{exp}}(\mu_R^2)/a_s(\mu_0^2)\right)\right]

When the renormalization scale crosses a flavor threshold matching conditions
have to be applied :cite:`Schroder:2005hy,Chetyrkin:2005ia`.

Splitting Functions
-------------------

The Altarelli-Parisi splitting kernels can be expanded in powers of the strong
coupling :math:`a_s(\mu^2)` and are given by :cite:`Moch:2004pa,Vogt:2004mw`

.. math ::
    \mathbf{P}(x,a_s(\mu^2)) &= \sum\limits_{j=0} a_s^{j+1}(\mu^2) \mathbf{P}^{(j)}(x) \\
    {\gamma}^{(j)}(N) &= -\mathcal{M}[\mathbf{P}^{(j)}(x)](N)

Note the additional minus in the definition of :math:`\gamma`.

Scale Variations
----------------

The usual procedure in solving |DGLAP| applied :doc:`here
</theory/DGLAP>` is to rewrite the equations in term of the running coupling
:math:`a_s` assuming the factorization scale :math:`\mu_F^2` (the inherit scale
of the |PDF|) and the renormalization scale :math:`\mu_R^2` (the inherit scale
for the strong coupling) to be equal.
This constraint, however, can be lifted in order to provide an estimation of the
missing higher order uncertainties (MHOU) coming from |DGLAP| evolution :cite:`AbdulKhalek:2019ihb`.
Since scale-dependent contributions to a perturbative prediction are fixed by |RGE| invariance,
the scale variation can be used to generate higher order contributions,
which are then taken as a proxy for the whole missing higher orders.
This method provides many advantages:

    * it naturally incorporates renormalization group invariance,
      as the perturbative order increases, estimates of MHOU decrease;
    * the same procedure can be used for any perturbative process,
      since the scale dependence of the strong coupling :math:`a_s(\mu^2)` and of PDFs is universal;

However there is no unique principle to determine the specific range of the scale variation;
the most used prescription specify to vary the factor :math:`\mu_F/\mu_R` in the range:
:math:`1/2 \le \mu_F/\mu_R \le 2`.

This variation can be performed at least at two different levels during the |PDF|
evolution, always evaluating the strong coupling at :math:`\mu_R^2`.

    * For ``SV_scheme='A'`` the variation is applied directly to the splitting functions
      and the anomalous dimension are then modified using :cite:`Vogt:2004ns`:

    .. math ::
        & \gamma^{(1)}(N) \to \gamma^{(1)}(N) - \beta_0 k \gamma^{(0)} \\
        & \gamma^{(2)}(N) \to \gamma^{(2)}(N) - 2 \beta_0 k \gamma^{(1)} - ( \beta_1 k - \beta_0^2 k^2) \gamma^{(0)} \\
        & k = \ln(\mu_F^2/\mu_R^2)

    * In ``SV_scheme='B'`` the |EKO| is multiplied by an additional kernel, such that
      the scale variation is applied to the whole |PDF| set:

    .. math ::
        \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(a_s \leftarrow a_s^0) = \left[ 1 - k \gamma + k^2(\gamma^{2} - \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial a_s} \beta(a_s)) + ... \right] \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(a_s \leftarrow a_s^0)

    where scale variation kernel is expanded consistently order by order in :math:`a_s`,
    leading to:

    .. math ::
        1 - k \gamma + k^2(\gamma^{2} - \frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial a_s} \beta(a_s)) =
        1 - a_s k \gamma^{(0)} + a_s^2 \left [ - k \gamma^{(1)} + \frac{1}{2} k^2 \gamma^{(0)} (\gamma^{(0)}+\beta_0) \right ]

    In this way the dependence of the |EKO| on :math:`k` is factorized outside the unvaried evolution kernel.
    This procedure is repeated for each different flavor patch present in the evolution path.

Notice that in principle the two methods should be equivalent, especially for fully linearized solutions
(`ModEv=truncated,ev_op_max_iterations=1`), where the difference depends only on the
perturbative expansion in :math:`a_s`.
However, in our implementation this is not exactly true; since the integral of :math:`\frac{\gamma}{\beta}`
is evaluated before the scale variation procedure is applied, the difference between the two
schemes depends also on the actual evolution distance and on the ratio :math:`\ln(\mu_F^2/\mu_R^2)`.

Heavy Quark Masses
------------------

In QCD also the heavy quark masses (:math:`m_{c}, m_{b}, m_{t}`) follow a |RGE|
and their values depend on the energy scale at which the quark is probed.
Masses do not play any role in a single flavour patch, but are important in
|VFNS| when more flavour schemes need to be joined (see :doc:`matching
conditions <Matching>`).

EKO implements two strategies for dealing with the heavy quark masses, managed
by the theory card parameter ``HQ``. The easiest and more common option for
PDFs evolution is ``POLE`` mass, where the physical quark masses are
specified as input.

On contrary selecting the option ``MSBAR`` the user can activate the *mass
running* in the |MSbar| scheme, as described in the following
paragraph.

If the initial condition for the mass is not given at a scale coinciding with
the mass itself (i.e. in the input theory card ``Qmhâ‰ mh``),
EKO needs to compute the scale at which the mass running function intersects
the identity function, in order to properly initiate the
:class:`~eko.threshold.ThresholdAtlas` and set the evolution path.

For each heavy quark :math:`h` we solve for :math:`m_h`:

.. math ::
    m_{\overline{MS},h}(m_h^2) = m_h


where the evolved |MSbar| mass is given by:

.. math ::
    m_{\overline{MS},h}(\mu^2) = m_{h,0} \int_{a_s(\mu_{h,0}^2)}^{a_s(\mu^2)} \frac{\gamma(a_s)}{\beta(a_s)} d a_s

and :math:`m_{h,0}` is the given initial condition at the scale
:math:`\mu_{h,0}`. Here there is a subtle complication since the solution
depends on the value :math:`a_s(\mu_{h,0}^2)` which is unknown and depends again
on the threshold path.
To overcome this issue, EKO initialize a temporary instance of the class
:class:`~eko.strong_coupling.StrongCoupling` with a fixed flavor number scheme,
with :math:`n_{f_{ref}}` active flavors at the scale :math:`\mu_{ref}`.

Then we check that, heavy quarks involving a number of active flavors
greater than :math:`n_{f_{ref}}` are given with initial conditions:

.. math ::
    m_h (\mu_h) \ge \mu_h

while the ones related to fewer active flavors follow:

.. math ::
    m_h (\mu_h) \le \mu_h

So for the former initial condition we will find the intercept between |RGE| and the identity
in the forward direction (:math:`m_{\overline{MS},h} \ge \mu_h`) and vice versa for the latter.

In doing so EKO takes advantage of the monotony of the |RGE| solution
:math:`m_{\overline{MS},h}(\mu^2)` with a vanishing limit for :math:`\mu^2
\rightarrow \infty`.

Now, being able to evaluate :math:`a_s(\mu_{h,0}^2)`, there are two ways of
solving the previous integral and finally compute the evolved
:math:`m_{\overline{MS},h}`. In fact, the function :math:`\gamma(a_s)` is the
anomalous QCD mass dimension and, as the :math:`\beta` function, it can be evaluated
perturbatively in :math:`a_s` up to :math:`\mathcal{O}(a_s^3)`:

.. math ::
    \gamma(a_s) &= - \sum\limits_{n=0} \gamma_n a_s^{n+1} \\

Even here it is useful to define :math:`c_k = \gamma_k/\beta_0, k>0`.

Therefore the two solution strategies are:

- ``method = "exact"``: the integral is solved exactly using the expression of
  :math:`\beta,\gamma` up to the specified perturbative order
- ``method = "expanded"``: the integral is approximate by the following expansion:

.. math ::
    m_{\overline{MS},h}(\mu^2) & = m_{h,0} \left ( \frac{a_s(\mu^2)}{a_s(\mu_{h,0}^2)} \right )^{c_0} \frac{j_{exp}(a_s(\mu^2))}{j_{exp}(a_s(\mu_{h,0}^2))} \\
    j_{exp}(a_s) &= 1 + a_s \left [ c_1 - b_1 c_0 \right ] + \frac{a_s^2}{2} \left [c_2 - c_1 b_1 - b_2 c_0 + b_1^2 c_0 + (c_1 - b_1 c_0)^2 \right]


The procedure is iterated on all the heavy quarks, updating the temporary instance
of :class:`~eko.strong_coupling.StrongCoupling` with the computed masses.

To find coherent solutions and perform the mass running in the correct patches it
is necessary to always start computing the mass scales closer to :math:`\mu_{ref}`.

Eventually, to ensure that the threshold values are properly set, we add a
consistency check, asserting:

.. math ::
    m_{\overline{MS},h} (m_h) \leq m_{\overline{MS},h+1} (m_h)

We provide the following as an illustrative example of how this procedure works:
when the strong coupling is given with boundary condition :math:`\alpha_s(\mu_{ref}=91, n_{f_{ref}}=5)`
then the heavy quarks initial conditions must satisfy:

.. math ::
    & \mu_{b} \le \mu_{ref} \le \mu_t \\
    & m_c (\mu_c) \le \mu_c \\
    & m_b (\mu_b) \le \mu_b \\
    & m_t (\mu_t) \ge \mu_t

and EKO will start solving the equation :math:`m_{\overline{MS},h}(m_h^2) = m_h`
in the order :math:`h={t,b,c}`.

Since the charm mass will be computed only when both the top and bottom threshold scales
are known, the boundary condition :math:`m_c(\mu_{c})` can be evolved safely below
the scale :math:`m_{\overline{MS},b}` where the solution of
:math:`m_{\overline{MS},c}(m_c^2) = m_c` is sitting.
