This file contains the |N3LO| Altarelli-Parisi splitting kernels.


For the non singlet anomalous dimensions:
    *   The part proportional to :math:`nf^3`,
        is common for :math:`\\gamma_{ns,+}^{(3)},`\\gamma_{ns,-}^{(3)},`\\gamma_{ns,v}^{(3)}`
        is copied exact from :cite:`Davies:2016jie` Eq. 3.6.
    *   In :math:`\\gamma_{ns,s}^{(3)}`: the part proportional to :math:`nf^2` is exact.
        In :math:`\\gamma_{ns,+}^{(3)},\\gamma_{ns,-}^{(3)}`:
        the part proportional to :math:`C_F (C_A - 2 C_F) nf^2` is parametrized,
        while the rest is exact.
